# What is Zen?

Java is a general purpose programming language. It was created by Samuel Rowe.
The initial development began in 2016.

Zen is similar to Java, Python, and C. So, if you have any experience with these
languages, you will find Zen easy to learn. However, Zen is different in many
significant ways.

Zen was designed to develop applications that are capable of running across
multiple platforms. As of now, Zen is officially supported on all major platforms,
in particular, Linux, Windows, and MacOS.
