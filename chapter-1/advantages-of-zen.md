# Advantages of Zen

## Zen is Simple

Zen is easy to learn and use. It has a clear syntax. With a combination of
powerful libraries, it makes tasks such as string manipulation and networking
extremely easy. If you know the basics of object oriented programming, you can
easily learn Zen.

Zen provides high-level collections such as lists, maps, sets, bags, queues,
stacks, and so on. You do not need external libraries or hours of coding to
use these collections.

## Zen is Platform Independent

The platform independence of Zen allows your programs to run on many types of
computers. In other words, applications written on one platform can be easily
ported to another platform.
 
Specifically, a Zen program runs on any computer with the Zen Virtual Machine.
As of this writing, Zen is available for all major platforms, in particular,
Linux, Windows, and MacOS.

## Zen is Object Oriented

Zen is an object-oriented programming language, which means your programs are
built with *objects*. Objects are programming entities that represent real-world
objects.

## Zen includes Automatic Memory Management

In programming, you can take a portion of your computers memory. This is known
as memory allocation. You can then store data there.

You can safely ignore the mechanisms of allocating the memory. But in many
programming languages, you need to safely tell *what happens to the memory
when you no longer need it*.

For example, in C and C++ you have to write code that will release the memory
your program allocated. If you forget this, your program will cause a *memory leak*.
Which means your program will soon run out of memory.

However, in Zen you do not have to release memory. The Zen Virtual Machine does
it for you! It has a special component called the garbage collector. It automatically
releases memory that is no longer in use.

## Zen is Concurrent

Zen allows two or more parts of your program to run simultaneously. This allows
your program to use multiple CPU cores efficiently.

## Zen is Secure

Zen is a secure programming language.

 * You do not have to deal with pointers.
 * You cannot access arrays with illegal indexes.

Thus, several security flaws like stack corruption or buffer overflow are
impossible to exploit.
